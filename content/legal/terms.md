## Introduction
These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern the relationship between the hosting provider ("Provider"), the client ("Client"), and P2P Cloud ("P2PCloud"), a decentralized marketplace for Virtual Private Server (VPS) services. By using the P2PCloud platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## Hosting Services
The Provider offers virtual machines to the Client for rent. The Provider is solely responsible for providing and maintaining the virtual machines, and the Client is responsible for all costs associated with renting them.

# Local regulations 
The hosting provider is required to abide by its local laws and regulations. Likewise, each customer must comply with their respective local laws and regulations.


## P2PCloud Platform
P2PCloud is a set of smart contracts and software that facilitates transactions between the Provider and the Client. P2PCloud does not provide hosting services itself and is not a party to the hosting agreements between the Provider and the Client.

## Beta Stage
P2PCloud is currently in open Beta stage and is not production-ready. By using P2PCloud, you acknowledge the potential risks and limitations associated with a Beta product.

## Limitation of Liability
P2PCloud does not assume any responsibility for any hacks, data loss, or other damages that may occur while using the platform. The Client and Provider agree to indemnify and hold harmless P2PCloud from any claims, damages, or losses resulting from their use of the platform.

## Testnet Instances
Testnet instances hosted by P2PCloud are for research and development purposes only. They should not be used for production or commercial applications.

## Vulnerability Disclosure
Clients and Providers must promptly disclose any vulnerabilities found in the P2PCloud platform to the P2PCloud team or make them public, so that appropriate action can be taken.

## Non-commercial Use of P2PCloud Software
Any software developed by the P2PCloud team cannot be used for commercial purposes without the prior written consent of P2PCloud. That does not apply to use of the P2PCloud platform itself.

## Changes to Terms & Conditions
P2PCloud reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

## Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where P2PCloud is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## Severability
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions shall remain in effect.

## Miscellaneous
These Terms, together with the P2PCloud Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding P2PCloud and supersede any prior agreements or understandings. No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced.
