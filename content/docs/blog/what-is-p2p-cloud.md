### What is P2P Cloud?
P2P Cloud is a decentralized marketplace that brings reliability and security to virtual machines(VMs) for less than a third of the cost. 

Thanks to a Trusted Execution Environment(TEE), anyone can run any application without worrying about outside tampering, whether you are a developer, startup, small medium-sized business(SMB), or RPC provider. This creates a trustless ecosystem where clients don't have to trust the provider.

P2P Cloud ensures security through an attestation process that takes a user's digital wallet signature, verifies user access, and encrypts the CPU, RAM, and disk.  

Allowing individuals to lease out unused hardware having AMD EPYC processors, P2P Cloud created a decentralized infrastructure marketplace connecting individuals to providers worldwide, reducing the risk of censorship, security breaches, and regional outages.

P2P Cloud doesn't have a native token, meaning anyone with a credit card or stablecoins on Avalanche can access the marketplace, rent out a server, and deploy their app, website, database, and RPC node in a trustless way for a third of the cost.
