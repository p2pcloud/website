### Overview:
About 67% of the world's infrastructure is controlled by three cloud providers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This centralization creates a risk of censorship and limits the types of applications and usage that can be conducted on their hardware. In web3 or traditional tech, maintaining a decentralized network is essential. Emerging companies such as P2P Cloud, Golem, and Pocket Network are creating decentralized alternatives to conventional infrastructure ecosystems.

For application developers, artists, server admins, and RPC providers working at a startup or medium size business(SMB), deploying on one of the major cloud providers can be costly for the resources or server(s) needed to perform any intensive operation. This cost makes it difficult for anyone to sustainably get their concept or project off the ground.

Because of this, we have seen an emergence of companies like P2P Cloud, POKT, Golem, Akash, and more aiming to disrupt the space by creating a more decentralized alternative to how we interact in traditional and web3 ecosystems.  

This post will explore how P2P Cloud and Golem Network are working to decentralize the world's infrastructure ecosystem. By breaking up virtual hardware on a microscale and allowing individuals to lease out unused hardware, both companies are creating a more decentralized alternative to traditional infrastructure ecosystems.

### What is P2P Cloud:
P2P Cloud  is a decentralized marketplace alternative that connects individuals, startups, small-medium businesses, and web3 node operators to providers offering Virtual Private Server (VPS) services, granting flexibility, security, reliability, and autonomy.

P2P Cloud offers a secure, decentralized alternative to centralized cloud providers that is cost-efficient for any client while enabling the healthy functioning of the internet ecosystem. By breaking up virtual hardware on a microscale and allowing individuals to lease out unused AMD-compatible hardware, P2P Cloud creates a decentralized infrastructure marketplace connecting individuals to hardware providers worldwide, reducing the risk of censorship, security breaches, and regional outages.

P2P Cloud uses an attestation process to secure its infrastructure. It encrypts the enclave using the user's Metamask signature on the provider's machine, guaranteeing local encryption so only the user can access the virtual machine. However, there are current limitations on who can be a provider since P2P Cloud can only run on hardware with AMD EPYC processors. P2P Cloud doesn't have a native token, meaning anyone with stablecoins on the Avalanche Network can access the marketplace, rent out a server, and deploy their app, web server, database, crypto node, and a more trustless way for a third of the cost.

### What is Golem: 
Golem is an open-source, decentralized supercomputer that connects users to providers leasing out their idle hardware and resources in a peer-to-peer fashion through their decentralized marketplace. Golem Network is a two-sided marketplace consisting of requestors and providers.

> * Requestor - anyone who needs to utilize idle computational resources on the network.
> * Provider- anyone with idle hardware wishes to sell its compute.  

At a high level, the standard flow of being a requestor is:

> * Define the requirements their app utilizes at run time(memory, CPU, GPU, etc.) or the runtime env(Node.js, Python, Swift, GO, Java Virtual Machine, etc.)
> * Select a provider(s) with the offered resources and get access to its resources 
> * Define the files(or code) the provider(s) need to execute. 
> * Send the files(or code) to the providers and get back the response 
 
Golem operates using their native token, GLM, that any requestor needs to be able to pay for the computational resources from the Provider when required. The Provider renting out their resources are then rewarded in the same token. 

### How do they help decentralize the web:
Golem and P2P Cloud technologies help decentralize the web by creating a distributed network of computers and enabling peer-to-peer interactions. They allow for more secure, private data sharing and efficient resource utilization. With a decentralized web, users can avoid centralized control and censorship, reduce the risk of single points of failure, and provide security and transparency.

### How are they different:
While both P2P Cloud and Golem Network aim to decentralize the web by providing alternatives to traditional infrastructure ecosystems, their approach and services differ.

Golem allows individuals to access resources as needed to process requests. At the same time, P2P Cloud will enable individuals to spin up their VPS instance through any provider with the required specs through the marketplace.

As for security, P2P Cloud is secured by default through its attestation process, which encrypts the enclave using your Metamask signature on the provider's machine, guaranteeing local encryption so that no one but you can access the VM. However, there are current limitations on who can be a provider since P2P Cloud can only run on hardware with AMD EPYC processors.

Golem currently isn't currently encrypted or have any security implementation, but they are still working on solutions to protect the requestor and providers on the network. As it stands, the hardening ultimately relies on the provider's setup of their machine.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the current centralized infrastructure ecosystem risks censorship and limits the types of applications and usage that can be conducted on their hardware. However, emerging companies such as P2P Cloud and Golem Network are creating decentralized alternatives to traditional infrastructure ecosystems, which offer more secure and private data sharing and more efficient resource utilization.

Golem is an open-source, decentralized supercomputer that connects users to providers leasing out their idle hardware and resources in a peer-to-peer fashion through their decentralized marketplace. On the other hand, P2P Cloud is a decentralized marketplace alternative that connects individuals, startups, small-medium businesses, and web3 node operators to providers offering Virtual Private Server (VPS) services.

While both companies help decentralize the web by creating a distributed network of computers and enabling peer-to-peer interactions, they differ in their approach. Golem allows individuals to access resources as needed to process requests, whereas P2P Cloud will enable individuals to spin up their VPS instance through any provider with the required specs through the marketplace.

Ultimately, using blockchain technology in conjunction with decentralized applications (dApps) can provide even more security and transparency for users, and we expect to see more emerging companies in the space. By creating a more decentralized alternative to how we interact in traditional and web3 ecosystems, we can move toward a more open and censorship-resistant internet that benefits all users.
