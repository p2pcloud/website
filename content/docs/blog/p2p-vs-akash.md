### Overview:
As it stands, the top leading cloud providers are AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This centralization creates a risk of censorship and limits the applications and usage that can be conducted on their hardware. In Web3 or traditional tech, maintaining a decentralized network is essential. Emerging companies such as P2P Cloud, Akash, and Pocket Network are creating decentralized alternatives to conventional infrastructure ecosystems.

For application developers, artists, server admins, and RPC providers working at a startup or medium size business(SMB), deploying on one of the major cloud providers can be costly for the resources or server(s) needed to perform any intensive operation. This cost makes it difficult for anyone to sustain their concept or project.

Because of this, we have seen an emergence of companies like P2P Cloud, POKT, Golem, Akash, and more aiming to disrupt the space by creating a more decentralized alternative to how we interact in traditional and web3 ecosystems.  

This post will explore how P2P Cloud and Akash Network are working to decentralize the world's infrastructure ecosystem. This post will explore how P2P Cloud and Akash Network are working to decentralize the world's infrastructure ecosystem.

### What is P2P Cloud:
P2P Cloud is a decentralized marketplace alternative that connects individuals, startups, small-medium businesses, and web3 node operators to providers offering Virtual Private Server (VPS) services, granting flexibility, security, reliability, and autonomy.

P2P Cloud offers a secure, decentralized alternative to centralized cloud providers that is cost-efficient for any client while enabling the healthy functioning of the internet ecosystem. By breaking up virtual hardware on a microscale and allowing individuals to lease out unused AMD-compatible hardware, P2P Cloud creates a decentralized infrastructure marketplace connecting individuals to hardware providers worldwide, reducing the risk of censorship, security breaches, and regional outages.

P2P Cloud created an attestation process to secure its infrastructure. It encrypts the enclave using the user's Metamask signature on the provider's machine, guaranteeing local encryption, so only the user can access the virtual machine. However, there are limitations on who can be a provider since P2P Cloud can only run on hardware with AMD EPYC processors. 

### What is Akash: 
Akash is an open-source cloud marketplace that allows anyone to buy or sell computing resources. Akash utilizesÂ two technologies, Cosmos and Kubernetes, enabling it to grow and scale with demand.

Cosmos allows Akash to keep on chain record of on-chain records of requests, bids, leases, and settlement payments using the Akash Token (AKT) that is being facilitated on the marketplace. Kubernetes allows Akash to deploy and manage containers at scale to trusted providers across the network. By doing so, users can run any cloud-native application on Akash.

Akash made it easy for tenants to connect and allocate resources to a single, or multiple providers when deploying any application by defining specific parameters in a manifest(YAML) file. The parameters tenants can specify are price, location, RAM, storage, etc. 

### How do they help decentralize the web:

Akash and P2P Cloud technologies help decentralize the web by allowing anyone to lease out unused resources, redefining how we deploy and manage applications in an open market for a third of the cost. By lowering the cost of leasing unused hardware and resources, P2P Cloud and Akash provide access for individual devs, Small and Medium-sized businesses(SMBs), and people in developing countries who otherwise can't afford to be in a long-term contract or monthly subscription.   

Because independent providers run every provider on both networks, it eliminates any single point of failure, making it secure and redundant. 

### How are they different:
While P2P Cloud and Akash Network aim to decentralize the web by providing alternatives to traditional infrastructure ecosystems, their approach and services differ.

First, Akash allows individuals to deploy applications in containers where P2P Cloud will enable individuals to spin up their VPS instance through any provider with the required specs.

As for security, P2P Cloud is secured by default through its attestation process, which encrypts the enclave using your Metamask signature on the provider's machine, guaranteeing encryption so that no one but you can access the VM. However, there are limitations on who can be a provider since P2P Cloud can only run on hardware with AMD EPYC processors.

Akash doesn't natively offer any security for the providers regarding TEE or secured enclaves. Still, they have [audited attributes](https://docs.akash.network/providers/akash-audited-attributes) that allow clients to choose which providers to use based on their trustworthiness. 

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the current centralized infrastructure ecosystem risks censorship and limits the types of applications and usage that can be conducted on their hardware. However, emerging companies such as P2P Cloud and Akash Network are creating decentralized alternatives to traditional infrastructure ecosystems, which offer more secure and private data sharing and more efficient resource utilization.

Akash is an open-source, decentralized supercomputer that connects users to providers leasing out their idle hardware and resources in a peer-to-peer fashion through their decentralized marketplace. On the other hand, P2P Cloud is a decentralized marketplace alternative that connects individuals, startups, small-medium businesses, and web3 node operators to providers offering Virtual Private Server (VPS) services.

While both companies help decentralize the web by creating a distributed network of computers and enabling peer-to-peer interactions, they differ in their approach. Akash allows individuals to access resources as needed to process requests, whereas P2P Cloud will enable individuals to spin up their VPS instance through any provider with the required specs through the marketplace.

Ultimately, using blockchain technology in conjunction with decentralized applications (dApps) can provide even more security and transparency for users, and we expect to see more emerging companies in the space. By creating a more decentralized alternative to how we interact in traditional and Web3 ecosystems, we can move toward a more open and censorship-resistant internet that benefits all users.
