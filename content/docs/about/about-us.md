### Introduction


Most of the internet today is hosted on large corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google servers, making it difficult for smaller server owners to compare prices and verify security. 


P2P Cloud bridges the gap between security and reliability by creating a Trusted Execution Environment(TEE). Clients can run their website, application, database, or RPC node in a secure environment without outside tampering creating a trustless environment. 

A transparent report card system lets users see every server's uptime and price per VM.   

### What Makes P2P Cloud Unique?
P2P Cloud developed a solution that utilizes attestation on AMD-compatible processors to enable encrypted enclaves, RAM, and CPU using your wallet's private key. Now users and providers don't have to worry about security risks like enclave attacks or leaks. 

Since AMD processors are commonly used in general-purpose applications, it allows users to continue to access the variety of compilers and development tools available, including C, C++, Java, Python, GO, JS, and more.

### Common Use Cases

P2P Cloud is versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes for individuals or small to medium-sized businesses(SMBs), such as:
-   Deploying backends for applications and websites with complete control
-   Running blockchain RPC nodes at a fraction of the cost of other providers
-   Hosting their project's database, whether  MongoDB, SQL, or other databases, with options such as Heroku's managed database services.
