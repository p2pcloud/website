### Introduction

Most cloud providers are controlled by large corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, which can make it difficult for smaller server owners to compare prices and verify security. 

P2P Cloud is a new cloud provider offering a trustless open market for users and server providers who need dedicated hardware for their day-to-day operations.

### What Makes P2P Cloud Unique?

Compared to SGX processors that provide hardware-based security features for processors. SGX processors include security features, such as memory encryption and access controls, but come with the cost of limiting the type of code executed within the enclave.

P2P Cloud developed a solution that utilizes attestation on AMD-compatible processors to enable encryption using your wallet's private key. This means that users and providers don't have to worry about security risks like enclave attacks or leaks. 

Since AMD processors are commonly used in general-purpose applications, it allows users to continue to access the variety of compilers and development tools available, including C, C++, Java, Python, GO, JS, and more.

### Common Use Cases

P2P Cloud is versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes for individuals or small to medium-sized businesses(SMBs), such as:
> -   Deploying backends for applications and websites with complete control
> -   Running blockchain RPC nodes at a fraction of the cost of other providers
> -   Hosting their project's database, whether  MongoDB, SQL, or other databases, with options such as Heroku's managed database services.
