### Introduction

Most cloud providers are controlled by large corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, which can make it difficult for smaller server owners to compare prices and verify security. P2P Cloud is a trustless open market for users and server providers who need dedicated hardware for their day-to-day operations.

### What Makes P2P Unique?

P2P Cloud doesn't rely on vulnerable technologies like Intel SGX to encrypt CPUs, unlike other cloud providers. This means that users and providers don't have to worry about security risks like enclave attacks or leaks. In addition, it's known security vulnerabilities, SGX limits what type of code can be compiled within the enclave, such as:
- Java/ JavaScript 
* PHP
* Ruby

Since P2P Cloud uses AMD SEV, clients can use any language compatible with a virtual machine(C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, GO, etc.). To learn more about how P2P Cloud ensures security and autonomy for its users, read our lite paper(coming soon).

Since P2P has no token and uses USDC, clients and providers aren't restricted to a specific Decentralized Exchange(DEX) or centralized exchange to obtain tokens. Meaning, both parties can use any network carrying USDC(ETH, Avalanche, Solana, Matic, etc.).  

### Common Use Cases

P2P Cloud is versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes, including:
-   Deploying backends for applications and websites with complete control and autonomy
-   Running blockchain nodes at a fraction of the cost of other providers
-   Setting up your VPN server using the most secure infrastructure available
